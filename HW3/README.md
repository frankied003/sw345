HW was a little tricky, but used a lot of the code from the lab. Was able to midify the tests easily to make sure they passed, meaning changing repo names to my repos. Additionally, running the server was good, but had issue with curl and posting data in the terminal. After using git-bash, i was able to use curl.

In the video, I had to use gitbash to send the curl function since it was not working in regular terminal. This is why you can't see me sending the request since screencast only records the software i was on when i started recording. You can see in the terminal though it recived a post request and body.
